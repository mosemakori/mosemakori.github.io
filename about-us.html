            <div class="eng">
                The Nakur Happy Church of Pipeline, Nakuru began from a small number of families who loved Jesus Christ.
                Through earnest prayer and God’s will, this church was officially recognized on November 12, 2010
                by the NCCK.
                In 2014, God blessed the church with a temporal building where we could congregate.
                 However, we wanted a place where we could freely worship and seek the Lord -
                an established church of our own.  For many years, we relentlessly prayed for God to
                provide us with a church.  Many times we thought we had found a church, only to be met with hardships.
                Nonetheless, we continued to trust in God’s plan for this church.  On September 2016, 
                the Lord provided a place to establish our church firmly in the community.
                After many difficulties with financing, planning, and remodeling, the Nakuru Happy Church 
                had a place of worship on February 2, 2017.  We are forever grateful to the God who
                constantly loves, provides, and delivers his people.

                                    He believes the praise ministry has a unique place in the church life.
                                    As a Co-Director, he wants to help each praise team member to grow in their leadership.
                                    He also serves in the Friday night Bible Study for the Young Adults.
                                    He believes that discussions are important for learning and growing in Christ.
                                    In his spare time, he enjoys eating out with his wife.

                                    Mrs. Nancy  followed her husband to the church few years ago.
                                    As a new wife, she felt a strong need for the women in the church to meet and grow
                                    together, supporting each other as sisters in Christ-thus she started the Women’s Fellowship Group.
                                    She also serves as a Bible Study Coordinator for the Young Adults.
